# Go Quotes API

This is an API built when I was learning Go. Here I am using 2 modules,

* (Gin)[github.com/gin-gonic/gin] - For quickly building the API
* (Colly)[github.com/gocolly/colly] - For web scrapping.

The API just hits the Goodreads quotes page and fires a search. It returns a list of Quotes with their authors. I have built it and deployed it on Heroku.
